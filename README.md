# PCB Business Card With NFC üõú
- A business card that that is able to transmit information to an nfc ready device while simultaneously harvesting energy to power an led. Based on a tutorial by [Maggie Liu](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card) for Hackclub.

- My intial inspiration for the project came from the Stylophone business card by [mitxela](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHVrY_xLM3c) on youtube . Afterwards I came across a ping pong business card by [Electronics Guy](https://youtu.be/x8Cdz36BOXc?si=Xfb_3ctz9GYAQnGA) and a business card that plays flappy bird by [StuckAtPrototype](https://youtu.be/y-lWarLUhfg?si=4j23PVfSiszfBYDo). However all of these were beyond my skill level to even attempt at recreating given I had never worked with hardware before, let alone PCBs. I would like to use this project as a taster in to the world of hardware design and hopefully have a nice project to show off since my current work is very software oriented.
