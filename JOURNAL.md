## 10/25/2025 6 AM - Started Work in Easy EDA  

So a while ago i stumbled upon a business card that was made out of a printed circuit board that could be used as a stylophone(https://youtu.be/zHVrY_xLM3c?si=_0zR_a_pAn7c3yRW). Using this project as inspiration I started searching for an appropriate tutorial for something similar, albeit a bit less complicated.
https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card This tutorial by Maggie Liu looked beginner friendly so I am now following it step by step for the NFC and light up functionality of the business card.

## 10/25/2025 7 AM - Routed the PCB and designed initial look  

Using the hacker card tutorial I converted the schematic to pcb. There seems to be a jumble of solder near the edges of the nfc coil which i will have to look into and pray that it wont cause a short circuit.

I also designed a rough sketch on the positions of the graphics on the circuit board using inkscape. I decided that every part of the silkscreen would be a vector image instead of relying on easyEda's text tools which gives me greater flexibility on the design.

## 10/25/2025 1 PM - Final touches on the Card  

Added all the graphics for it to be a functional business card. Using various overlays of different layers I was able to get a cool effect for my logo and the social media icons. I was also able to fix the broken nfc antenna by just using a different part in the library.

## 10/25/2025 2 PM - Ordering the Card on JLCPCB  

Started the ordering process on JLCPCB. I had to repeat a few time because I thought a duplicate order was being created only to realise that was the assembly of the board itself. I was tempted to go with ENIG for the coating but was quickly discouraged by seeing the price jump up by twice the amount it would've been with Leadfree HASL, which i chose over HASL as the card would be handled frequently and the last thing I needed was lead poisoning. Now all that is left to do is updating the Github repo with the necessary files and shipping the project.

## 10/26/2025 - Completed the Github Repo  

After reading the submission guidelines for the project, i realised the build of materials generated with EasyEDA might not be the one the team was hoping for. So I created a new one from scratch while keeping the original one in the PCB folder in the repository. Had a small issue with LibreOffice producing a csv without any commas but that was easily fixed by converting the whole document into ODF and back into CSV. I think everything should be in order and so i will now ship the project and hopefully be approved!
